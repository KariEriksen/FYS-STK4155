\section{Introduction}
There are many problems that require a probability estimate as output. 
This could for example predicting whether a 
person will develop a specific disease given genetic information. Another example, which we will examine closer, is to 
predict if a given spin-configuration generated from the two-dimension Ising model is ordrered or disordered. Problems of this 
type are referred to as \textit{classification} problems. 

Classification is fundamentally different from the regression problems we studied previously, 
in the sense that the predicted outcome only takes values across discrete categories. 
Thus, we will need different tools than that of linear regression. In this work we first consider 
\textit{logistic regression} as a method for classification. 

Somethingsomething background deep neural networks 

Apply it to one-dim Ising and classification of two-dim Ising.

\section{Theory}
In the following we outline the theory of the present work. We 
consider logistic regression as a model for classification problems. Furthermore, neural networks are discussed 
both in the context of regression analysis and classification. The theoretical aspects of linear regression have been 
discussed in previous work and is not repeated here.

In contrast to the linear regression model, we can not find the optimal parameters of the logistic or neural network 
models analytically. Thus, we have ro rely on numerical methods for optimization. In particular we will give a brief summary
gradient descent methods.

\subsection{Logistic regression}
Suppose that we are given a dataset $\{ (\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, y_i) \}_{i=1}^n $ where we have $p$ predictors 
for each data sample $\mathbf{x}^{(i)} = \{ x_1^{(i)}, \cdots, x_p^{(i)} \}$. The responses/outcomes $y_i$ are discrete and can 
only take values from $k=0,1,\dots,K-1$ (i.e $K$ classes). The goal is to predict the output classes given $n$ samples each containing 
$p$ predictors. Throughout this section we assume that there are just two possible outcomes, i.e $y_i \in \{0,1\}$.

In logistic regression, in contrast to linear regressions, we model the \textit{probability} that $y_i$ belongs 
to class $1$, given $\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$. Let $p(y|x)$ denote the probability of event $y$ given $x$,
then the \textit{logistic model} is 
\begin{align}
 p \left(y=1 | \mathbf{x}; \beta \right) &= \frac{1}{1+e^{-\beta \cdot \mathbf{x}}} \\
 p \left(y=0 | \mathbf{x}; \beta \right) &= 1 - p \left(y=1 | \mathbf{x}; \beta \right).
\end{align}
Here $\beta = (\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_p)$ are the parameters of the model. Note the appearance of the intercept 
term $\beta_0$. In order to keep notation compact $\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ can be augmented to incorporate the intercept by adding 
a $1$ to each sample, i.e 
\begin{equation*}
 \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \rightarrow \{ 1, x_1^{(i)}, \dots, x_p^{(i)} \}.
\end{equation*}
The term $\beta \cdot \mathbf{x} = \beta_0 + \sum_{k=1}^p \beta_k x_k $ is known as the \textit{log-odds} and the function 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(\beta \cdot \mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\beta \cdot \mathbf{x}}} 
\end{equation}
is called the \textit{sigmoid} of $\beta \cdot \mathbf{x}$. Also note that the sigmoid satisfies 
\begin{align}
 \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \sigma(t) &= 1 \\
 \lim_{t \rightarrow -\infty} \sigma(t) &= 0
\end{align}
which justifies its use as a model for probabilities.

The logistic model can now be used for classification by predicting a class using the estimated probabilities according to 
\begin{equation}
 \hat{y}_i = \begin{cases}
            1 \ \ \text{if }  p \left(y=1 | \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) \geq 0.5 \\
            0 \ \ \text{if }  p \left(y=1 | \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) < 0.5. \\
           \end{cases}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Training the logistic model}
How do we train the logistic model? The answer is to use the prinicple of \textit{maximum likelihood}. Under the assumption 
that every sample $\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ is indenpendent, the likelihood is given by 
\begin{align}
 L(\beta) &= \prod_{i : y_i = 1} p(y_i=1 | \mathbf{x}^{(i)}) \prod_{i : y_i = 0} p(y_i=0 | \mathbf{x}^{(i)}) \nonumber \\
 &= \prod_{i=1}^n p(y_i=1 | \mathbf{x}^{(i)})^{y_i} ( 1-p(y_i=1 | \mathbf{x}^{(i)}))^{1-y_i}.
\end{align}
Then, the parameters $\beta$ are chosen to maximize the likelihood. 

It turns out that it is easier to work with the \textit{log-likelihood}
\begin{align}
 l(\beta) &= \log(L(\beta)) \nonumber \\
 &= \sum_{i=1}^n y_i p(y_i=1 | \mathbf{x}^{(i)}) + (1-y_i)( 1-p(y_i=1 | \mathbf{x}^{(i)}).
\end{align}
Maximizing the logarithm of a function is equivalent to maximizing the function itself. 

In order to see this, let $f(x)$ be a
real valued function and let $x^*$ be a maximum point of $f(x)$, i.e 
\begin{equation}
 f'(x^*) = 0, \ \ f''(x^*) < 0.
\end{equation}
Furthermore, assume that $f(x) > 0$ and consider $\log(f(x))$. Taking derivatives we have that 
\begin{align}
 &\frac{d}{dx} \log (f(x)) = \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} \\
 \Rightarrow &\frac{d}{dx} \log(f(x^*)) = 0 \\
 &\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \log(f(x)) = \frac{f''(x) f(x) - f'(x)^2}{f(x)^2} \\
 \Rightarrow &\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \log(f(x^*)) < 0, 
\end{align}
where the last inequality follows from the fact that we assumed $f'(x^*) = 0, \, f''(x^*) < 0$ and $f(x) > 0$. Hence, $x^*$
also maximize $\log(f(x))$.

Thus, taking $\beta$ to maximize the log-likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood itself. Finally, we take our 
cost function to be the so-called \textit{cross-entropy} which is defined as the negative log-likelihood 
\begin{equation}
 C(\beta) \equiv = -l(\beta).
\end{equation}
Then, $\beta$ is found by \textit{minimizing} the cross-entropy. 

Note here that we can not find a analytical solution for the maximizer. This means that we have to use a
numerical opimization algorithm, such as gradient descent which we discuss later, to find the optimal parameters.

However, the gradient of the cross entropy can be given in closed-form 
\begin{equation}
 \nabla_\beta C(\beta) = - X^{T} \left( \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{p} \right). 
\end{equation}
Here we have defined \begin{align}
\mathbf{y} &\equiv (y_1,\dots,y_n), \\       
      \mathbf{p} &\equiv \left( p(y_1=1|\mathbf{x}^{(1)}),\dots,p(y_n=1|\mathbf{x}^{(n)}) \right)
      \end{align}
and $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times (p+1)}$ is the design-matrix containing $\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ as its i-th row.


\subsection[Neural networks]{Neural networks \protect\footnote{This section follows \cite{ledum2017computational} because I am lazy.}}
Artificial neural networks (sometimes just neural networks) are computational models with the ability to \textit{learn} from examples it is shown. The structure of the networks are inspired by biological networks constituting animal brains. Artificial neural networks fall under the category of machine learning\textemdash a subfield of artificial intelligence\textemdash and we will, in the following, expose the precise mechanism of the model learning. 

Such neural networks can be created in numerous ways, but we will focus exclusively on the most common architecture, namely \emph{multilayer perceptrons} (MLP). The MLP neural networks are built from \emph{layers} of connected \emph{neurons}. In the artificial network, an input value (possibly a vector) is fed into the network model and then propagated through the layers, being processed through each neuron in turn. We will deal only with \emph{feed forward} ANNs, meaning information always flows through the net in one direction only\textemdash essentially there are no loops. The entire ANN produces an output value (possibly a vector), which means we can think of it as a complicated function $\mathbb{R}^n\mapsto \mathbb{R}^m$. As we will see, it is possible to write down a closed form expression for this function and it is\textemdash crucially\textemdash possible to devise an efficient algorithm for calculating the gradient of the entire function w.r.t.\ any of the internal parameters.

\subsubsection{Neurons and layers}
A neuron is simply a model function for propagating information through the network. Inspired by biological neurons, the artificial neuron "fires" if it is stimulated by a sufficiently strong signal. The artificial neuron receives a vector of input values ${\bf p}$. If the neuron is part of the very first hidden layer (this will be expanded upon shortly), the input is simply the input value(s) to the NN. If one or more layers preceded the current one, ${\bf p}$ is a vector of outputs from the neurons in the previous layer.

Then the bias $b$ is added, and the activation function $f$ is applied to the resulting ${\bf w}^T{\bf p}+b$. The output $\tilde p$ goes on to become input for neurons in the next layer. \label{fig:neuron}}
\end{centering}
\end{figure*}
The neuron is connected to the previous layers' neurons, and the strength of the connection is represented by a vector of weights, ${\bf w}$. Let us now consider a neuron which we will label by the index $k$. The output from neuron $i$ (of the preceding layer), $p_i$, is multiplied by the weight corresponding to the $i$\----$k$ connection, $w_i$. The combined weight vector multiplied by the input vector gives part of the total activation of the neuron, 
\begin{align}
\sum_{i=1}^Nw_ip_i = {\bf w}^T{\bf p}.
\end{align}
The remaining part is known as the bias, $b_k$. This is a single real number. There is one for each neuron, and it acts as modifier making the neuron more or less likely to fire independently of the input. 

The total input is passed to an activation (or transfer) function, which transforms it in some specified way, yielding the neuron \emph{output} $\hat p_k$. This in turn becomes input for the neurons in subsequent layers. 

Various different activation functions $f$ are used for different purposes. The function may be linear or non-linear, but should vanish for small inputs and \emph{saturate} for large inputs. For reasons that will become clear shortly, the conditions we enforce on $f$ is continuity, boundedness, as well as non-constantness. We also demand it be monotonically increasing. Numerous different transfer functions are in popular use today, and we will outline some of them in section \ref{sect:activations}.

In total, the action of a single neuron can be written
\begin{align}
\text{input}\ \rightarrow f\left({\bf w}^T{\bf p}+b\right) = \tilde p \ \rightarrow \ \text{output}.
\end{align}
A schematic representation of the single neuron connected to the previous and acting as input for the next layers is shown in \fig{neuron}. 

The full artificial neural network is built up of layers of neurons. Data is fed sequentially through the network, starting in the input layer (the input values can be thought of as the first layer), through the \emph{hidden} layers, and ending up in the output layer. The propagation needs to happen simultaneously across the network, as layer $k$ needs the fully computed output of layer $k-1$ before the activations can be calculated. 

A layer is\textemdash put simply\textemdash a collection of neurons, all of which are connected to the previous layer's neurons and the next layer's neurons. Let us label the individual neurons in layer $k$ by index $i$, i.e.\ $n_i^k$. The bias of neuron $i$ is then denoted $b^k_i$, and the weights connecting $n_i^{k-1}$ to $n_j^k$ is called $w_{ji}$. For each neuron there is a corresponding weight, so the weight vector is denoted $\bm{w}_i^k$. The combination of all weight vectors for layer $k$ thus makes a matrix, which we will denote by a capital $W^k$,
\begin{align}
W^k=\pmat{ccccc}{
  w^k_{11} & w^k_{12} & w^k_{13} & \dots & w^k_{1N} \\
  w^k_{21} & w^k_{22} & w^k_{23} & \dots & w^k_{2N} \\
  w^k_{31} & w^k_{32} & w^k_{33} & \dots & w^k_{3N} \\
  \vdots  &  \vdots   &   \vdots   & \ddots & \vdots \\
  w^k_{N1} & w^k_{N2} & w^k_{N3} & \dots & w^k_{NN}
}, 
\end{align}
or more compactly $(W^k)_{ij}=w^k_{ij}$. The collection of all biases for layer $k$ is $\mathbf{b}^k$. In this notation, we may write the propagation of the signal from layer $k-1$ to layer $k$ as 
\begin{strip}
\begin{align}
\mathbf{y}^k &= f(W^k\mathbf{y}^{k-1}+\mathbf{b}^k) 
=f\left( \bmat{ccccc}{
  w^k_{11} & w^k_{12}  & \dots & w^k_{1N} \\
  w^k_{21} & w^k_{22}  & \dots & w^k_{2N} \\
  \vdots  &  \vdots      & \ddots & \vdots \\
  w^k_{N1} & w^k_{N2}  & \dots & w^k_{NN}
} 
 \bmat{c}{y^{k-1}_1\\ y^{k-1}_2  \\ \vdots \\ y^{k-1}_N}  
+\bmat{c}{b^{k}_1  \\ b^{k}_2    \\ \vdots \\ y^{k}_N} \right) \label{eq:nnmatrix}
\end{align}
\end{strip}
or in Einstein notation 
\begin{align}
y^k_i= f\big(w^k_{ij}y^{k-1}_j+b^k_i  \big). \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (\text{no sum over }k\text{ implied})
\end{align}
In all of the preceeding three equations, application of $f$ indicates \emph{element wise} functional evaluation.

It is clear from \eq{nnmatrix} that propagation through an entire layer can be thought of as a matrix-vector product, a vector-vector summation, and a subsequent application of the transfer function $f$ element-wise on the resulting vector. 

A schematic representation of a layer consisting of three artificial neurons in a fully connected ANN is shown in \fig{layer}.

\subsection{Gradient Descent}
Almost every problem in machine learning and data science starts
with a dataset $X$, a model $g(\theta)$, which is a function of the parameters $\theta$ and a cost 
function $C(X, g(\theta))$ that allows us to judge how well the
model $g(\theta)$ explains the observations $X$. The model is fit by finding the values of $\theta$ that minimize the 
cost function. Ideally we would be able to solve for $\theta$ analytically, however this is not possible in general and 
we must use numerical methods to compute the minimum.
\subsubsection{The method of steepest descent}
The basic idea of gradient descent is that a function $F(\mathbf{x})$, $ \mathbf{x} \equiv (x_1,\cdots,x_n)$, 
decreases fastest if one goes from $\bf {x}$ in the direction of the negative gradient $-\nabla F(\mathbf{x})$.
It can be shown that if 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k - \gamma_k \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_k), \ \ \gamma_k > 0
\end{equation}
for $\gamma_k$ small enough, then $F(\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) \leq F(\mathbf{x}_k)$. This means that for a sufficiently 
small $\gamma_k$ we are always moving towards smaller function values, i.e a minimum. 

This observation is the basis of the method of steepest descent, which is also referred to as just gradient descent (GD). 
One starts with an initial guess $\mathbf{x}_0$ for a minimum of $F$ and compute new approximations according to
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k - \gamma_k \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_k), \ \ k \geq 0.
\end{equation}
The parameter $\gamma_k$ is often referred to as the step length or the learning rate in the context of ML.

Ideally the sequence $\{ \mathbf{x}_k \}_{k=0}$ converges to a \textit{global} minimum of the function $F$. 
In general we do not know if we are in a global or local minimum.  
In the special case when $F$ is a \textit{convex function, all local minima are also global minima}, so in this case gradient 
descent can converge to the global solution. The advantage of this scheme is that it is conceptually simple and 
straightforward to implement. 

However the method in this form has some severe limitations:

\begin{itemize}
 \item In machine learing we are often faced with non-convex high dimensional cost functions with many local minimum. 
 Since GD is deterministic we will get stuck in a local minimum, if the method converges, unless we have a very good intial 
 guess. This also implies that the scheme is sensitive to the chosen initial condition.
 \item Note that gradient is a function of $\mathbf{x} = (x_1,\cdots,x_n)$ which makes it expensive to compute numerically.
 \item GD is sensitive to the choice of learning rate $\gamma_k$. This is due to the fact that we are only guaranteed 
that $F(\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) \leq F(\mathbf{x}_k)$ for \textit{sufficiently} small $\gamma_k$. The problem is to determine an 
optimal learning rate. If the learning rate is chosen to small the method will take a long to converge and if it is to 
large we can experience erratic behavior.
\item Many of these shortcomings can be alleviated by introducing randomness. One such method is that of Stochastic Gradient Descent 
(SGD).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Stochastic Gradient Descent}
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and variants thereof address some of the shortcomings of the Gradient descent method discussed above. 

The underlying idea of SGD comes from the observation that the cost function, which we want to minimize, can almost always be 
written as a sum over $n$ datapoints $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^n$,
\begin{equation}
 C(\mathbf{\theta}) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{\theta}). 
\end{equation}
This in turn means that the gradient can be computed as a sum over $i$-gradients 
\begin{equation}
\nabla_\theta C(\mathbf{\theta}) = \sum_i^n \nabla_\theta c_i(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{\theta}).  
\end{equation}
Now, stochasticity/randomness is introduced by only taking the gradient on a subset of the data called minibatches.  
If there are $n$ datapoints and the size of each minibatch is $M$, there will be $n/M$ minibatches. We denote these 
minibatches by $B_k$ where $k=1,\cdots,n/M$. 

As an example, suppose we have $10$ datapoints $( \mathbf{x}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{x}_{10} )$ and we choose to have $M=5$
minibathces, then each minibatch contains two datapoints. In particular we have 
$B_1 = (\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2), \cdots, B_5 = (\mathbf{x}_9,\mathbf{x}_{10})$. Note that if you choose $M=1$ you have 
only a single batch with all datapoints and on the other extreme, you may choose $M=n$ resulting in a minibatch for each 
datapoint, i.e $B_k = \mathbf{x}_k$.

The idea is now to approximate the gradient by replacing the sum over all datapoints with a sum over the datapoints in one the 
minibatches picked at random in each gradient descent step
\begin{align}\nabla_\theta C(\mathbf{\theta}) = &\sum_{i=1}^n \nabla_\theta c_i(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{\theta}) \nonumber \\
\rightarrow &\sum_{i \in B_k}^n \nabla_\theta c_i(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{\theta}).
\end{align}
                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thus a gradient descent step now looks like 
\begin{equation} \theta_{j+1} = \theta_j - \gamma_j \sum_{i \in B_k}^n \nabla_\theta c_i(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{\theta}) \end{equation}
where $k$ is picked at random with equal probability from the interval $[1,n/M]$. An iteration over the number of 
minibathces $n/M$ is commonly referred to as an epoch. Thus it is typical to choose a number of epochs and for each epoch 
iterate over the number of minibatches.
 
Taking the gradient only on a subset of the data has two important benefits. First, it introduces randomness 
which decreases the chance that our opmization scheme gets stuck in a local minima. Second, if the size of the 
minibatches are small relative to the number of datapoints ($M < n$), the computation of the gradient is much cheaper 
since we sum over the datapoints in the k-th minibatch and not all $n$ datapoints. 

A natural question is when do we stop the search for a new minimum? One possibility is to compute the full gradient after a 
given number of epochs and check if the norm of the gradient is smaller than some threshold and stop if true. However, 
the condition that the gradient is zero is valid also for local minima, so this would only tell us that we are close to a 
local/global minimum. However, we could also evaluate the cost function at this point, store the result and continue 
the search. If the test kicks in at a later stage we can compare the values of the cost function and keep the $\theta$ that 
gave the lowest value. 

Another approach is to let the step length $\gamma_j$ depend on the number of epochs in such a way that it becomes very small 
after a reasonable time such that we do not move at all. 

As an example, let $e = 0,1,2,3,\cdots$ denote the current epoch and let $t_0, t_1 > 0$ be two fixed numbers. Furthermore, 
let $t = e \cdot m + i$ where $m$ is the number of minibatches and $i=0,\cdots,m-1$. Then the function 
\begin{equation}\gamma_j(t; t_0, t_1) = \frac{t_0}{t+t_1} \end{equation}
goes to zero as the number of epochs gets large. I.e. we start with a step length $\gamma_j (0; t_0, t_1) = t_0/t_1$ which 
decays in "time" t. 

In this way we can fix the number of epochs, compute $\theta$ and evaluate the cost function at the end. Repeating the 
computation will give a different result since the scheme is random by design. Then we pick the final $\theta$ that gives 
the lowest value of the cost function.

\section{Model systems}
In this work we apply the machine learning algorithms discussed to the one- and two-dimensional Ising model. 
Linear regression and neural networks are used to estimate the coupling constant of the one-dimensional Ising model.

The two-dimensional Ising model is known to show phase transition. In particular, these phases can be labeled as ordered 
or disordered. Thus it is interesting to investigate whether logistic regression or neural networks can be trained to to 
classify the phases.
